# ChatBot

## Introduction 
In this task, I will introduce how to leverage the power of LLMs with RAG. The results can be viewed on [Jira](https://inspire-lab.atlassian.net/browse/AFT-77). The **RAG code** has been modified from [this repo](https://github.com/pixegami/langchain-rag-tutorial) and the remaining code was entirely written by **Khôi**.

## Install dependencies

1. Do the following before installing the dependencies found in `requirements.txt` file because of current challenges installing `onnxruntime` through `pip install onnxruntime`. 

    - For MacOS users, a workaround is to first install `onnxruntime` dependency for `chromadb` using:

    ```python
     conda install onnxruntime -c conda-forge
    ```
    See this [thread](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/11037) for additonal help if needed. 

     - For Windows users, follow the guide [here](https://github.com/bycloudai/InstallVSBuildToolsWindows?tab=readme-ov-file) to install the Microsoft C++ Build Tools. Be sure to follow through to the last step to set the enviroment variable path.


2. Now run this command to install dependenies in the `requirements.txt` file. 

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install markdown depenendies with: 

```python
pip install "unstructured[all-docs]"
```

4. Install Tesseract for unstructured, follow guide [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html) for more information:

```python
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
sudo apt install libtesseract-dev
```

5. We are going to use Llama 3 available on Hugging Face. Therefore, requesting the [permission](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) to use it and loging in hugging face before running is required. Replace `$HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` with your token.

```python
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
huggingface-cli login --token $HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN
```

## Create database
Several example data located at `data`. You can add your custom data.

Create the Chroma DB.

```python
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
python backend/create_database.py
```

## Run chatbot app

```python
python app.py
```

**Please note that** the response time may vary depending on the resources available on your computer (12 GB VRAM at least).
